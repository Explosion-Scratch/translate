# Google Translate JavaScript module

This module exposes two functions: the [`token()`](#token) funciton and the [`translate()`](#translate) function. To translate you need a google translate token. From there it's pretty easy!

# If it doesn't work

If it gives you a `429` error in console then just wait, it's probably because I was playing with it and made google think my cors server was causing some bad traffic. This should undo in a bit.
