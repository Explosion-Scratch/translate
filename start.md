# Google Translate JavaScript module

This module exposes a [`translate()`](#translate) function.

# If it doesn't work

If it gives you a `429` error in console then just wait, it's probably because you were using it too much. Try adding a proxy, such as `https://cors.explosionscratc.repl.co` in the options.
